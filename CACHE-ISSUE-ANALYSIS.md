# Cache Issue Analysis & Solution

## Problem Diagnosis

### What's Happening
1. Videos are loaded via standard `<video src={url}>` tags
2. Chrome's **HTTP cache** intercepts and stores videos automatically
3. The **Service Worker** Cache API is bypassed for many video requests
4. The `/cache` page only checks Service Worker's Cache API
5. Result: GBs in Chrome's cache, but UI shows 0 videos cached

### Why This Happens
- Modern browsers aggressively cache media files in HTTP cache
- Service worker routing may not intercept all video requests
- Prefetch downloads go to Cache API, but playback uses HTTP cache
- Two separate caching mechanisms operating independently

## Solutions (in order of recommendation)

### ✅ Solution 1: Unified Cache Detection (RECOMMENDED)
**Keep current architecture, improve detection UI**

Pros:
- No breaking changes
- Leverages both caching mechanisms
- Simple implementation
- Works with existing code

Cons:
- Can't programmatically clear HTTP cache
- Two cache systems remain

Implementation:
1. Update `/cache` page to show BOTH caches
2. Use Storage API estimate for total size
3. Show Cache API entries for SW-managed content
4. Show storage estimate for all cached data

### ⚠️ Solution 2: Force All Videos Through Service Worker
**Intercept video playback with fetch() and Blob URLs**

Pros:
- Single cache system (Cache API)
- Full programmatic control
- Accurate cache reporting

Cons:
- Breaking change to video player
- More complex code
- Potential performance impact
- May break seeking/range requests

Implementation:
```typescript
// Fetch video via Cache API, create Blob URL
const cachedResponse = await caches.match(videoUrl);
const blob = await cachedResponse.blob();
const blobUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
videoElement.src = blobUrl;
```

### ❌ Solution 3: IndexedDB (NOT RECOMMENDED)
**Store video blobs in IndexedDB**

Pros:
- Full programmatic control
- Structured data storage

Cons:
- Much more complex implementation
- Must handle chunking manually
- Range requests (seeking) become complex
- No performance benefit
- Reinventing what Cache API does

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Improve Cache Detection (Quick Fix)
1. Update `/cache` page to show total storage estimate
2. Add note explaining Chrome's HTTP cache
3. Link to `chrome://settings/content/siteDetails?site=https://your-domain.com`
4. Show Cache API entries separately

### Phase 2: (Optional) Enhanced Control
IF you need programmatic cache clearing:
1. Implement Blob URL approach for video playback
2. Migrate existing cache to Cache API
3. Update video player component
4. Test range requests and seeking

### Phase 3: (Future) Service Worker Improvements
1. Ensure all video routes are intercepted
2. Add cache warmup on install
3. Implement cache versioning
4. Add cache cleanup on quota exceeded

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Navigate to `/cache-debug` to see actual Cache API contents
2. Check Chrome DevTools → Application → Cache Storage
3. Check chrome://cache/ to see HTTP cache
4. Decide: Quick fix (update UI) or architectural change (Blob URLs)?

## Code Changes Needed for Solution 1 (Quick Fix)

File: `app/cache/page.tsx`
- Add total storage estimate display
- Add explanatory text about Chrome's caching
- Show Cache API entries
- Add link to Chrome's site storage settings

File: `hooks/use-video-cache.ts`
- Already has `storageSnapshot` - just use it better in UI
- No changes needed

## Code Changes Needed for Solution 2 (Blob URLs)

File: `app/video-player/_components/video-player.tsx`
- Replace direct `src={videoUrl}` with blob URL approach
- Add cache check before fetching
- Handle errors and fallbacks

File: `public/sw-custom.js`
- Ensure video routes are intercepted
- May need adjustment to route matching
