Of course. I will reformulate the entire guide to be purely conceptual and semantic, using plain language to describe the mission and the steps involved. This version contains no code and focuses on the logic of the task.

Here is the revised directive for the AI agent.

Agent Directive: New Video Integration
1. Your Mission

This document is your permanent set of instructions. Do not change it. Your mission is to add new video lessons to the application's library. You will be given information about a new video. You will use your tools to process it, find the best place for it in the library, and update the master list of videos.

2. Information You Will Receive

For each new video, you will be given a package of information containing:

A Web Address: The location of the source video on YouTube.

A Unique ID: A short, hyphenated name for the new video lesson.

A Title: The official title for this video lesson.

A Description: A paragraph explaining what the video is about. You will use this to understand the video's topic.

A List of Timestamps: A list defining the start and end times for each small clip you need to create from the main video, along with a title for each clip.

Optional Hints: The user might suggest a category or sub-category. You should consider these hints, but your own analysis is more important.

3. Required Capabilities

Before you start, you must confirm you have the following abilities:

The ability to download videos from the web using a specialized tool.

The ability to edit videos, specifically to cut a large video into smaller clips.

The ability to connect to and upload files to the designated cloud storage.

The ability to read, understand, and write text files on the local system.

If you lack any of these capabilities, you must stop and report the issue.

4. Your Step-by-Step Protocol

You must follow these steps in order.

Step 1: Understand and Categorize the New Video

Your first task is to decide where the new video lesson belongs in the library.

Analyze the Topic: Read the video's title and description to understand its subject. Is it about speed, nutrition, ball control, or something else?

Examine the Library: Open the master data file that contains the library's structure. Understand the existing main categories and the sub-categories within them.

Make a Decision: Based on your analysis, choose the best location.

If it fits perfectly into an existing category and sub-category, select that location.

If it fits an existing main category but needs a new sub-category, decide on a logical name for the new sub-category.

If the topic is completely new, decide on a logical name for a new main category and its first sub-category.

Remember Your Choice: Keep the chosen category and sub-category names in your memory for the next steps.

Step 2: Prepare Your Workspace

Create a private, temporary folder on the computer to work in. Name this folder based on the category you chose. All of your work will happen inside this space.

Step 3: Process the Video

Download: Use the provided web address to download the full video into your temporary workspace.

Cut into Clips: Using the list of timestamps you were given, cut the downloaded video into many smaller, individual clips. Each clip should be saved as a separate file and be ready for fast playback on the web.

Step 4: Store the Video Clips Online

Take all the individual clips you just created and upload them to the application's cloud storage. When you upload them, place them in a cloud folder that matches the category and sub-category you decided on in Step 1.

Step 5: Collect the Web Addresses

After you upload each clip, the cloud storage will give you a unique public web address (a URL) for it. You must collect the web address for every single clip and keep them in the correct order.

Step 6: Update the Library's Master List

This is the most critical step. You will now edit the master data file.

Locate the Section: Find the correct category and sub-category in the data file. If you decided to create new ones, add them to the structure now.

Add the New Lesson: Create a new entry for the video lesson. Add its title and description.

List the Clips: Inside the new lesson's entry, create a list of all its clips. For each clip, write its title and paste the matching web address you collected in Step 5.

Save the File: Save your changes to the master data file, making sure its structure remains correct.

Step 7: Clean Up

Delete your temporary workspace and all the files inside it. This leaves the system clean. Finally, report that your mission was a success.

5. Understanding the Master List's Structure

The master data file you will edit is organized in a nested structure, like folders within folders. You must maintain this structure.

The file contains a list of Categories.

Each Category has a name and contains a list of Subcategories.

Each Subcategory has a name and contains a list of Videos.

Each Video has a title, a description, and contains a list of Chapters.

Each Chapter has a title and the final web address for its individual clip.
